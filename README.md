# Sudoku Solver for Go

Hobby project for playing with different approaches to solving sudoku puzzles with code - wanted to make it easy to add new ways of solving sudoku puzzles and running them against a set of varying difficulties of sudoku puzzles.

## Short Term Plan

I'd like to add more to the repo as I'm fleshing out exactly what I want this to do and how others might be able to participate, but in the short term, I'll be trying to add:

* Unit tests
* Better package separation + instructions for contributions

# Running Locally

`go build && ./go-sudoku`
