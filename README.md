# Sudoku Solver for Go

Hobby project for playing with different approaches to solving sudoku puzzles with code - wanted to make it easy to add new ways of solving sudoku puzzles and running them against a set of varying difficulties of sudoku puzzles.

I'll be adding more to this (tests, better package separation) as I go along!

# Running Locally

`go build && ./go-sudoku`
